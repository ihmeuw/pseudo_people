Input Data
==========

pseudpoeple leverages the power of the `Vivarium <https://vivarium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ microsimulation platform to incorporate real, publicly-accessible data about the US population. The input data for pseudopeople is the output of a Vivarium simulation and must be in a specific format for the dataset generating functions to work.
There are currently three collections of pseudopeople input data:

- Sample data (a fictional population of ~10,000 simulants living in Anytown, US, included with the pseudopeople package)
- Rhode Island (a fictional population of ~1,000,000 simulants living in a simulated state of Rhode Island)
- United States (a fictional population of ~330,000,000 simulants living throughout a simulated United States)

When generating a dataset, pseudopeople uses the included sample data by default unless an explicit path to another directory containing pseudopeople input data is specified.

Accessing the large-scale input data
------------------------------------

To gain access to the larger-scale input data (Rhode Island and United States), follow these steps:

#. Log in to `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ (you must first create a GitHub account if you don't have one).
#. Open a new `Data access request issue <https://github.com/ihmeuw/pseudopeople/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=data_access_request.yml>`- using the template under the Issues tab pseudopeople's GitHub page.
#. Fill out the information on the access request form to tell us about your project. You can simply put "Data access request" in the title field.
#. We will get back to you after we receive your request!
