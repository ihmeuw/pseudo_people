pseudpoeple uses the output of a `Vivarium <https://vivarium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ microsimulation as the input for the datasets it generates. The pseudopeople input data must be in a specific format for the dataset generating functions to work. There are currently three collections of pseudopeople input data:

- Sample data (a simulated population of ~10,000 simulants, included with the pseudopeople package)
- Rhode Island (a simulated population of ~1,000,000 simulants living in a fictional state of Rhode Island)
- United States (a simulated population of ~330,000,000 simulants living throughout a fictional United States)

A collection of small-scale sample datasets is included with the software, and pseudopeople uses this sample data by default unless an explicit path to another directory containing pseudopeople input data is specified.
There is a data access request process to obtain larger-scale data that can be used with pseudopeople. Currently
