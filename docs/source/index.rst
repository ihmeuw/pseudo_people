pseudopeople is a Python package that generates realistic simulated data about a
fictional United States population, designed for use in testing entity
resolution (record linkage) methods or other data science algorithms at scale.

| üôà **Simulated**: These are made-up people! No need to worry about confidentiality.
| üìù **Versatile**: Generate multiple datasets about the same population: censuses, surveys, and administrative records.
| ‚úîÔ∏è **Verifiable**: Ground-truth unique identifiers are present in every dataset for checking link correctness.
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable**: Configure the levels of noise in each dataset.
| üí™ **Full-scale**: Supports generating datasets at the size of the real-life US population.

The fictional US population was generated by stochastically simulating multiple
decades of population dynamics such as fertility, mortality, migration and
employment. pseudopeople builds on this fictional population data by simulating
errors in the data collection process to create realistic, noisy datasets.

pseudopeople is currently in a public beta release.
Things are still in flux!
If you notice any issues, please let us know `on GitHub <https://github.com/ihmeuw/pseudopeople/issues>`_.

Introduction
------------

The Simulation Science Team of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) 
is excited to introduce pseudopeople, the Python package that simplifies Entity Resolution (ER) research and 
development. This package generates large-scale, simulated population data according to specifications by the user, 
to replicate a range of complexities found in real applications of probabilistic record linkage software.
With sensitive data often required for ER, accessing and testing new methods and software has been a challenge - 
until now. Our innovative approach creates realistic, simulated data including name, address, and date of birth, 
without compromising privacy.

Our work builds on the success of previous data synthesis projects, such as FEBRL_, GeCo_, and SOG_, and 
incorporates real, publicly accessible data about the US population with the power of  our simulation platform Vivarium_.

.. _quickstart:

Quickstart
----------

pseudopeople requires a version of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ between 3.8 and 3.11 (inclusive) to be installed.
Once Python is installed, you can install pseudopeople with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ by running the command:

.. highlight:: console

::

   $ pip install pseudopeople

Or, you can install from source on `the pseudopeople GitHub repository <https://github.com/ihmeuw/pseudopeople>`_.

Then, generate a small-scale simulated decennial census:

::

   $ python

.. highlight:: pycon

::

   >>> import pseudopeople as psp
   >>> census = psp.generate_decennial_census()
   >>> census

The simulated people in these datasets are called "simulants."
Both datasets have a :code:`simulant_id` column that uniquely identifies an individual.
The unique :code:`simulant_id` present in both datasets provides us with a truth deck,
which we wouldn't have for a linkage task with real, sensitive data.

::

   >>> true_matches = len(set(census.simulant_id) & set(taxes.simulant_id))
   >>> print(f"There are {true_matches:,} true matches to find between these datasets!")
   There are 6,181 true matches to find between these datasets!

Now, see how many your record linkage method can find -- without access to the truth deck, of course!

Not linking in Python?
Just save your datasets as files, for example CSV files:

::

   >>> census.to_csv('census.csv')
   >>> taxes.to_csv('taxes.csv')

Now you can load these datasets in any environment that can read CSV.

What's next?
------------

Now that you've generated a simulated dataset with pseudopeople,
here are some next steps:


* To get started with customizing the noise in your datasets,
  try out the :ref:`tutorial on configuring noise <tutorial_configuring_noise>`.
* To learn more about the kinds of simulated datasets that are available,
  check out our :ref:`Datasets page <datasets_main>`.
* If you need larger datasets with millions instead of thousands of rows,
  take a look at the :ref:`Input Data page <input_data_main>`.
* To dive deeper into noise, read the docs about :ref:`noise <noise_main>` and
  :ref:`noise configuration <configuration_main>`.
