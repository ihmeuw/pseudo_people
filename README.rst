Pseudo People is a package intended to add configurable noise to a simulated
census-scale data-set written using standard scientific Python tools.

**Pseudo People requires Python 3.7-3.10 to run**

You can install ``pseudo_people`` from PyPI with pip:

  ``> pip install pseudo_people``

or build it from source with

  ``> git clone https://github.com/ihmeuw/pseudo_people.git``

  ``> cd pseudo_people``

  ``> python setup.py install``

This will make the ``pseudo_people`` library available to python and install a
command-line executable called ``...`` that you can use to verify your
installation with

  ``> ... test``
